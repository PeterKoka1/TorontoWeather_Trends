# TorontoWeather_Trends
Found trends in weather patterns provided by the airport of Toronto. Created a train/test split and plotted a predicted 1940 degree estimate and a 2010 degree estimate to compare. 

The model predicted an average temperature in 1940 to be 6.89 degrees while the predicted average for 2010 was 8.12 degrees. Attached is also a scatter plot of the data to visualize a gradual increase in temperature throughout the years!
